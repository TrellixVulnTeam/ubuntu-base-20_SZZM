Package: amphora-agent
Description-md5: 69dc8ed981d458e6684a63e3ef5be102
Description-en: OpenStack Load Balancer Service - Amphora agent
 Openstack Load Balancer as a Service, codenamed Octavia was borne
 out of the Neutron LBaaS project. Its conception influenced
 the transformation of the Neutron LBaaS project, as Neutron LBaaS
 moved from version 1 to version 2. Starting with the Liberty
 release of OpenStack, Octavia has become the reference implementation
 for Neutron LBaaS version 2.
 .
 Octavia accomplishes its delivery of load balancing services by
 managing a fleet of virtual machines, containers, or bare metal
 servers—collectively known as amphorae— which it spins up on demand.
 This on-demand, horizontal scaling feature differentiates Octavia from
 other load balancing solutions, thereby making Octavia truly
 suited “for the cloud.”.
 .
 This package provides Octavia Amphora Agent.

 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

 It advertises three classes of routes:
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on non-DVR routers, the
    nexthop is the centralized router.
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on DVR routers, the nexthop is
    the appropriate compute node.
  * Prefix routes for directly routable tenant networks with address scopes,
    the nexthop is the centralized router, the same for DVR and CVR.

Description-md5: 14e61d74db9df4b1edc860ca4ff8ade6
Description-en: C# like language for the GObject system - vapi files
 Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming
 language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional
 runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to
 applications and libraries written in C.
 .
 valac, the Vala compiler, is a self-hosting compiler that translates
 Vala source code into C source and header files.  It uses the GObject
 type system to create classes and interfaces declared in the Vala
 source code. This package also contains the vala-gen-introspect and
 vapigen binaries that will automatically generate Vala bindings.
 .
 This package contains the bundled vapi files, which make some
 common libraries available for vala development.

Package: vlan
Description-md5: 514da32d98bf421e8b5c27f0f43242eb
Description-en: ifupdown integration for vlan configuration
 This package contains integration scripts for configuring vlan
 interfaces via ifupdown (/etc/network/interfaces).
 For further details see vlan-interfaces(5) man page in this package.
 .
 Please note that these integration scripts only supports a limited
 set of interface naming schemes, which means you might be better
 off with writing your own ifupdown hooks using ip(route2)
 directly in /etc/network/interfaces rather than using this package.
 .
 It currently also ships a wrapper script for backwards compatibility
 called vconfig, that replaces the old deprecated vconfig program
 with translations to ip(route2) commands.
 This compatibility shim might be dropped in future releases, please
 use ip(route2) commands directly.
 .
 Your kernel needs vlan support for this to work, see "modinfo 8021q".

Package: xdmx
Description-md5: 9e6fe3aa398121b6dd37b516ff31f0fc
Description-en: distributed multihead X server
 Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its
 display device(s). It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that
 might be located on different machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server
 that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
 rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
 front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
 configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
 line), the clients see a single large screen.

Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
